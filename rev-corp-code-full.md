This Code shall be known as the "Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines."

||SECTION 2. Corporation Defined. — ||

A corporation is an artificial being created by operation of law, having the right of succession and the powers, attributes, and properties expressly authorized by law or incidental to its existence.

||SECTION 3. Classes of Corporations. — ||

Corporations formed or organized under this Code may be stock or nonstock corporations. Stock corporations are those which have capital stock divided into shares and are authorized to distribute to the holders of such shares, dividends, or allotments of the surplus profits on the basis of the shares held. All other corporations are nonstock corporations.

||SECTION 4. Corporations Created by Special Laws or Charters. — ||

Corporations created by special laws or charters shall be governed primarily by the provisions of the special law or charter creating them or applicable to them, supplemented by the provisions of this Code, insofar as they are applicable.

||SECTION 5. Corporators and Incorporators, Stockholders and Members. — ||

Corporators are those who compose a corporation, whether as stockholders or shareholders in a stock corporation or as members in a nonstock corporation. Incorporators are those stockholders or members mentioned in the articles of incorporation as originally forming and composing the corporation and who are signatories thereof.

||SECTION 6. Classification of Shares. — ||

The classification of shares, their corresponding rights, privileges, or restrictions, and their stated par value, if any, must be indicated in the articles of incorporation. Each share shall be equal in all respects to every other share, except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation and in the certificate of stock.

The shares in stock corporations may be divided into classes or series of shares, or both. No share may be deprived of voting rights except those classified and issued as "preferred" or "redeemable" shares, unless otherwise provided in this Code: Provided, That there shall always be a class or series of shares with complete voting rights.

Holders of nonvoting shares shall nevertheless be entitled to vote on the following matters:

(a) Amendment of the articles of incorporation;

(b) Adoption and amendment of bylaws;

(c) Sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the corporate property;

(d) Incurring, creating, or increasing bonded indebtedness;

(e) Increase or decrease of authorized capital stock;

(f) Merger or consolidation of the corporation with another corporation or other corporations;

(g) Investment of corporate funds in another corporation or business in accordance with this Code; and

(h) Dissolution of the corporation.

Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, the vote required under this Code to approve a particular corporate act shall be deemed to refer only to stocks with voting rights.

The shares or series of shares may or may not have a par value: Provided, That banks, trust, insurance, and preneed companies, public utilities, building and loan associations, and other corporations authorized to obtain or access funds from the public, whether publicly listed or not, shall not be permitted to issue no-par value shares of stock.

Preferred shares of stock issued by a corporation may be given preference in the distribution of dividends and in the distribution of corporate assets in case of liquidation, or such other preferences: Provided, That preferred shares of stock may be issued only with a stated par value. The board of directors, where authorized in the articles of incorporation, may fix the terms and conditions of preferred shares of stock or any series thereof: Provided, further, That such terms and conditions shall be effective upon filing of a certificate thereof with the Securities and Exchange Commission, hereinafter referred to as the "Commission".

Shares of capital stock issued without par value shall be deemed fully paid and nonassessable and the holder of such shares shall not be liable to the corporation or to its creditors in respect thereto: Provided, That no-par value shares must be issued for a consideration of at least Five pesos (P5.00) per share: Provided, further, That the entire consideration received by the corporation for its no-par value shares shall be treated as capital and shall not be available for distribution as dividends.

A corporation may further classify its shares for the purpose of ensuring compliance with constitutional or legal requirements.

||SECTION 7. Founders' Shares. — ||

Founders' shares may be given certain rights and privileges not enjoyed by the owners of other stocks. Where the exclusive right to vote and be voted for in the election of directors is granted, it must be for a limited period not to exceed five (5) years from the date of incorporation: Provided, That such exclusive right shall not be allowed if its exercise will violate Commonwealth Act No. 108, otherwise known as the "Anti-Dummy Law"; Republic Act No. 7042, otherwise known as the "Foreign Investments Act of 1991"; and other pertinent laws.

||SECTION 8. Redeemable Shares. — ||

Redeemable shares may be issued by the corporation when expressly provided in the articles of incorporation. They are shares which may be purchased by the corporation from the holders of such shares upon the expiration of a fixed period, regardless of the existence of unrestricted retained earnings in the books of the corporation, and upon such other terms and conditions stated in the articles of incorporation and the certificate of stock representing the shares, subject to rules and regulations issued by the Commission.

||SECTION 9. Treasury Shares. — ||

Treasury shares are shares of stock which have been issued and fully paid for, but subsequently reacquired by the issuing corporation through purchase, redemption, donation, or some other lawful means. Such shares may again be disposed of for a reasonable price fixed by the board of directors.

A corporation whose term has expired may apply for a revival of its corporate existence, together with all the rights and privileges under its certificate of incorporation and subject to all of its duties, debts and liabilities existing prior to its revival. Upon approval by the Commission, the corporation shall be deemed revived and a certificate of revival of corporate existence shall be issued, giving it perpetual existence, unless its application for revival provides otherwise.

The articles of incorporation of a nonstock corporation may be amended by the vote or written assent of majority of the trustees and at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members.

The original and amended articles together shall contain all provisions required by law to be set out in the articles of incorporation. Amendments to the articles shall be indicated by underscoring the change or changes made, and a copy thereof duly certified under oath by the corporate secretary and a majority of the directors or trustees, with a statement that the amendments have been duly approved by the required vote of the stockholders or members, shall be submitted to the Commission.

The amendments shall take effect upon their approval by the Commission or from the date of filing with the said Commission if not acted upon within six (6) months from the date of filing for a cause not attributable to the corporation.

||SECTION 16. Grounds When Articles of Incorporation or Amendment May be Disapproved. — ||

The Commission may disapprove the articles of incorporation or any amendment thereto if the same is not compliant with the requirements of this Code: Provided, That the Commission shall give the incorporators, directors, trustees, or officers a reasonable time from receipt of the disapproval within which to modify the objectionable portions of the articles or amendment. The following are grounds for such disapproval:

(a) The articles of incorporation or any amendment thereto is not substantially in accordance with the form prescribed herein;

(b) The purpose or purposes of the corporation are patently unconstitutional, illegal, immoral or contrary to government rules and regulations;

(c) The certification concerning the amount of capital stock subscribed and/or paid is false; and

(d) The required percentage of Filipino ownership of the capital stock under existing laws or the Constitution has not been complied with.

No articles of incorporation or amendment to articles of incorporation of banks, banking and quasi-banking institutions, preneed, insurance and trust companies, NSSLAs, pawnshops, and other financial intermediaries shall be approved by the Commission unless accompanied by a favorable recommendation of the appropriate government agency to the effect that such articles or amendment is in accordance with law.

||SECTION 17. Corporate Name. — ||

No corporate name shall be allowed by the Commission if it is not distinguishable from that already reserved or registered for the use of another corporation, or if such name is already protected by law, or when its use is contrary to existing law, rules and regulations.

A name is not distinguishable even if it contains one or more of the following:

(a) The word "corporation", "company", "incorporated", "limited", "limited liability", or an abbreviation of one of such words; and

(b) Punctuations, articles, conjunctions, contractions, prepositions, abbreviations, different tenses, spacing, or number of the same word or phrase.

The Commission, upon determination that the corporate name is: (1) not distinguishable from a name already reserved or registered for the use of another corporation; (2) already protected by law; or (3) contrary to law, rules and regulations, may summarily order the corporation to immediately cease and desist from using such name and require the corporation to register a new one. The Commission shall also cause the removal of all visible signages, marks, advertisements, labels, prints and other effects bearing such corporate name. Upon the approval of the new corporate name, the Commission shall issue a certificate of incorporation under the amended name.

If the corporation fails to comply with the Commission's order, the Commission may hold the corporation and its responsible directors or officers in contempt and/or hold them administratively, civilly and/or criminally liable under this Code and other applicable laws and/or revoke the registration of the corporation.

||SECTION 18. Registration, Incorporation and Commencement of Corporate Existence. — ||

A person or group of persons desiring to incorporate shall submit the intended corporate name to the Commission for verification. If the Commission finds that the name is distinguishable from a name already reserved or registered for the use of another corporation, not protected by law and is not contrary to law, rules and regulations, the name shall be reserved in favor of the incorporators. The incorporators shall then submit their articles of incorporation and bylaws to the Commission.

If the Commission finds that the submitted documents and information are fully compliant with the requirements of this Code, other relevant laws, rules and regulations, the Commission shall issue the certificate of incorporation.

A private corporation organized under this Code commences its corporate existence and juridical personality from the date the Commission issues the certificate of incorporation under its official seal and thereupon the incorporators, stockholders/members and their successors shall constitute a body corporate under the name stated in the articles of incorporation for the period of time mentioned therein, unless said period is extended or the corporation is sooner dissolved in accordance with law.

||SECTION 19. De Facto Corporations. — ||

The due incorporation of any corporation claiming in good faith to be a corporation under this Code, and its right to exercise corporate powers, shall not be inquired into collaterally in any private suit to which such corporation may be a party. Such inquiry may be made by the Solicitor General in a quo warranto proceeding.

||SECTION 20. Corporation by Estoppel. — ||

All persons who assume to act as a corporation knowing it to be without authority to do so shall be liable as general partners for all debts, liabilities and damages incurred or arising as a result thereof: Provided, however, That when any such ostensible corporation is sued on any transaction entered by it as a corporation or on any tort committed by it as such, it shall not be allowed to use its lack of corporate personality as a defense. Anyone who assumes an obligation to an ostensible corporation as such cannot resist performance thereof on the ground that there was in fact no corporation.

||SECTION 21. Effects of Non-Use of Corporate Charter and Continuous Inoperation. — ||

If a corporation does not formally organize and commence its business within five (5) years from the date of its incorporation, its certificate of incorporation shall be deemed revoked as of the day following the end of the five (5)-year period.

However, if a corporation has commenced its business but subsequently becomes inoperative for a period of at least five (5) consecutive years, the Commission may, after due notice and hearing, place the corporation under delinquent status.

A delinquent corporation shall have a period of two (2) years to resume operations and comply with all requirements that the Commission shall prescribe. Upon compliance by the corporation, the Commission shall issue an order lifting the delinquent status. Failure to comply with the requirements and resume operations within the period given by the Commission shall cause the revocation of the corporation's certificate of incorporation.

The Commission shall give reasonable notice to, and coordinate with the appropriate regulatory agency prior to the suspension or revocation of the certificate of incorporation of companies under their special regulatory jurisdiction.

@TAB Title III: Board of Directors/Trustees and Officers

## TITLE III

## Board of Directors/Trustees and Officers

||SECTION 22. The Board of Directors or Trustees of a Corporation; Qualification and Term. — ||

Unless otherwise provided in this Code, the board of directors or trustees shall exercise the corporate powers, conduct all business, and control all properties of the corporation.

Directors shall be elected for a term of one (1) year from among the holders of stocks registered in the corporation's books, while trustees shall be elected for a term not exceeding three (3) years from among the members of the corporation. Each director and trustee shall hold office until the successor is elected and qualified. A director who ceases to own at least one (1) share of stock or a trustee who ceases to be a member of the corporation shall cease to be such.

The board of the following corporations vested with public interest shall have independent directors constituting at least twenty percent (20%) of such board:

(a) Corporations covered by Section 17.2 of Republic Act No. 8799, otherwise known as "The Securities Regulation Code," namely those whose securities are registered with the Commission, corporations listed with an exchange or with assets of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00) and having two hundred (200) or more holders of shares, each holding at least one hundred (100) shares of a class of its equity shares;

(b) Banks and quasi-banks, NSSLAs, pawnshops, corporations engaged in money service business, preneed, trust and insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries; and

(c) Other corporations engaged in businesses vested with public interest similar to the above, as may be determined by the Commission, after taking into account relevant factors which are germane to the objective and purpose of requiring the election of an independent director, such as the extent of minority ownership, type of financial products or securities issued or offered to investors, public interest involved in the nature of business operations, and other analogous factors.

An independent director is a person who, apart from shareholdings and fees received from the corporation, is independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities as a director.

Independent directors must be elected by the shareholders present or entitled to vote in absentia during the election of directors. Independent directors shall be subject to rules and regulations governing their qualifications, disqualifications, voting requirements, duration of term and term limit, maximum number of board memberships and other requirements that the Commission will prescribe to strengthen their independence and align with international best practices.

||SECTION 23. Election of Directors or Trustees. — ||

Except when the exclusive right is reserved for holders of founders' shares under Section 7 of this Code, each stockholder or member shall have the right to nominate any director or trustee who possesses all of the qualifications and none of the disqualifications set forth in this Code.

At all elections of directors or trustees, there must be present, either in person or through a representative authorized to act by written proxy, the owners of majority of the outstanding capital stock, or if there be no capital stock, a majority of the members entitled to vote. When so authorized in the bylaws or by a majority of the board of directors, the stockholders or members may also vote through remote communication or in absentia: Provided, That the right to vote through such modes may be exercised in corporations vested with public interest, notwithstanding the absence of a provision in the bylaws of such corporations.

A stockholder or member who participates through remote communication or in absentia, shall be deemed present for purposes of quorum.

The election must be by ballot if requested by any voting stockholder or member.

In stock corporations, stockholders entitled to vote shall have the right to vote the number of shares of stock standing in their own names in the stock books of the corporation at the time fixed in the bylaws or where the bylaws are silent, at the time of the election. The said stockholder may: (a) vote such number of shares for as many persons as there are directors to be elected; (b) cumulate said shares and give one (1) candidate as many votes as the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of the shares owned; or (c) distribute them on the same principle among as many candidates as may be seen fit: Provided, That the total number of votes cast shall not exceed the number of shares owned by the stockholders as shown in the books of the corporation multiplied by the whole number of directors to be elected: Provided, however, That no delinquent stock shall be voted. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or in the bylaws, members of nonstock corporations may cast as many votes as there are trustees to be elected but may not cast more than one (1) vote for one (1) candidate. Nominees for directors or trustees receiving the highest number of votes shall be declared elected.

If no election is held, or the owners of majority of the outstanding capital stock or majority of the members entitled to vote are not present in person, by proxy, or through remote communication or not voting in absentia at the meeting, such meeting may be adjourned and the corporation shall proceed in accordance with Section 25 of this Code.

The directors or trustees elected shall perform their duties as prescribed by law, rules of good corporate governance, and bylaws of the corporation.

||SECTION 24. Corporate Officers. — ||

Immediately after their election, the directors of a corporation must formally organize and elect: (a) a president, who must be a director; (b) a treasurer, who must be a resident; (c) a secretary, who must be a citizen and resident of the Philippines; and (d) such other officers as may be provided in the bylaws. If the corporation is vested with public interest, the board shall also elect a compliance officer. The same person may hold two (2) or more positions concurrently, except that no one shall act as president and secretary or as president and treasurer at the same time, unless otherwise allowed in this Code.

The officers shall manage the corporation and perform such duties as may be provided in the bylaws and/or as resolved by the board of directors.

||SECTION 25. Report of Election of Directors, Trustees and Officers, Non-Holding of Election and Cessation from Office. — ||

Within thirty (30) days after the election of the directors, trustees and officers of the corporation, the secretary, or any other officer of the corporation, shall submit to the Commission, the names, nationalities, shareholdings, and residence addresses of the directors, trustees and officers elected.

The non-holding of elections and the reasons therefor shall be reported to the Commission within thirty (30) days from the date of the scheduled election. The report shall specify a new date for the election, which shall not be later than sixty (60) days from the scheduled date.

If no new date has been designated, or if the rescheduled election is likewise not held, the Commission may, upon the application of a stockholder, member, director or trustee, and after verification of the unjustified non-holding of the election, summarily order that an election be held. The Commission shall have the power to issue such orders as may be appropriate, including orders directing the issuance of a notice stating the time and place of the election, designated presiding officer, and the record date or dates for the determination of stockholders or members entitled to vote.

Notwithstanding any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws to the contrary, the shares of stock or membership represented at such meeting and entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for purposes of conducting an election under this section.

Should a director, trustee or officer die, resign or in any manner cease to hold office, the secretary, or the director, trustee or officer of the corporation, shall, within seven (7) days from knowledge thereof, report in writing such fact to the Commission.

||SECTION 26. Disqualification of Directors, Trustees or Officers. — ||

A person shall be disqualified from being a director, trustee or officer of any corporation if, within five (5) years prior to the election or appointment as such, the person was:

(a) Convicted by final judgment:

(1) Of an offense punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding six (6) years;

(2) For violating this Code; and

(3) For violating Republic Act No. 8799, otherwise known as "The Securities Regulation Code";

(b) Found administratively liable for any offense involving fraudulent acts; and

(c) By a foreign court or equivalent foreign regulatory authority for acts, violations or misconduct similar to those enumerated in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.

The foregoing is without prejudice to qualifications or other disqualifications, which the Commission, the primary regulatory agency, or the Philippine Competition Commission may impose in its promotion of good corporate governance or as a sanction in its administrative proceedings.

||SECTION 27. Removal of Directors or Trustees. — ||

Any director or trustee of a corporation may be removed from office by a vote of the stockholders holding or representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding capital stock, or in a nonstock corporation, by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members entitled to vote: Provided, That such removal shall take place either at a regular meeting of the corporation or at a special meeting called for the purpose, and in either case, after previous notice to stockholders or members of the corporation of the intention to propose such removal at the meeting. A special meeting of the stockholders or members for the purpose of removing any director or trustee must be called by the secretary on order of the president, or upon written demand of the stockholders representing or holding at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock, or a majority of the members entitled to vote. If there is no secretary, or if the secretary, despite demand, fails or refuses to call the special meeting or to give notice thereof, the stockholder or member of the corporation signing the demand may call for the meeting by directly addressing the stockholders or members. Notice of the time and place of such meeting, as well as of the intention to propose such removal, must be given by publication or by written notice prescribed in this Code. Removal may be with or without cause: Provided, That removal without cause may not be used to deprive minority stockholders or members of the right of representation to which they may be entitled under Section 23 of this Code.

The Commission shall, motu proprio or upon verified complaint, and after due notice and hearing, order the removal of a director or trustee elected despite the disqualification, or whose disqualification arose or is discovered subsequent to an election. The removal of a disqualified director shall be without prejudice to other sanctions that the Commission may impose on the board of directors or trustees who, with knowledge of the disqualification, failed to remove such director or trustee.

||SECTION 28. Vacancies in the Office of Director or Trustee; Emergency Board. — ||

Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors or trustees other than by removal or by expiration of term may be filled by the vote of at least a majority of the remaining directors or trustees, if still constituting a quorum; otherwise, said vacancies must be filled by the stockholders or members in a regular or special meeting called for that purpose.

When the vacancy is due to term expiration, the election shall be held no later than the day of such expiration at a meeting called for that purpose.

(h) Other generally accepted form of consideration.

Where the consideration is other than actual cash, or consists of intangible property such as patents or copyrights, the valuation thereof shall initially be determined by the stockholders or the board of directors, subject to the approval of the Commission.

Shares of stock shall not be issued in exchange for promissory notes or future service. The same considerations provided in this section, insofar as applicable, may be used for the issuance of bonds by the corporation.

The issued price of no-par value shares may be fixed in the articles of incorporation or by the board of directors pursuant to authority conferred by the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, or if not so fixed, by the stockholders representing at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock at a meeting duly called for the purpose.

||SECTION 62. Certificate of Stock and Transfer of Shares. — ||

The capital stock of corporations shall be divided into shares for which certificates signed by the president or vice president, countersigned by the secretary or assistant secretary, and sealed with the seal of the corporation shall be issued in accordance with the bylaws. Shares of stock so issued are personal property and may be transferred by delivery of the certificate or certificates indorsed by the owner, his attorney-in-fact, or any other person legally authorized to make the transfer. No transfer, however, shall be valid, except as between the parties, until the transfer is recorded in the books of the corporation showing the names of the parties to the transaction, the date of the transfer, the number of the certificate or certificates, and the number of shares transferred. The Commission may require corporations whose securities are traded in trading markets and which can reasonably demonstrate their capability to do so to issue their securities or shares of stocks in uncertificated or scripless form in accordance with the rules of the Commission.

No shares of stock against which the corporation holds any unpaid claim shall be transferable in the books of the corporation.

||SECTION 63. Issuance of Stock Certificates. — ||

No certificate of stock shall be issued to a subscriber until the full amount of the subscription together with interest and expenses (in case of delinquent shares), if any is due, has been paid.

Subject to the provisions of the subscription contract, the board of directors may, at any time, declare due and payable to the corporation unpaid subscriptions and may collect the same or such percentage thereof, in either case, with accrued interest, if any, as it may deem necessary.

Payment of unpaid subscription or any percentage thereof, together with any interest accrued, shall be made on the date specified in the subscription contract or on the date stated in the call made by the board. Failure to pay on such date shall render the entire balance due and payable and shall make the stockholder liable for interest at the legal rate on such balance, unless a different interest rate is provided in the subscription contract. The interest shall be computed from the date specified, until full payment of the subscription. If no payment is made within thirty (30) days from the said date, all stocks covered by the subscription shall thereupon become delinquent and shall be subject to sale as hereinafter provided, unless the board of directors orders otherwise.

||SECTION 67. Delinquency Sale. — ||

The board of directors may, by resolution, order the sale of delinquent stock and shall specifically state the amount due on each subscription plus all accrued interest, and the date, time and place of the sale which shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date the stocks become delinquent.

Notice of the sale, with a copy of the resolution, shall be sent to every delinquent stockholder either personally, by registered mail, or through other means provided in the bylaws. The same shall be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the province or city where the principal office of the corporation is located.

Unless the delinquent stockholder pays to the corporation, on or before the date specified for the sale of the delinquent stock, the balance due on the former's subscription, plus accrued interest, costs of advertisement and expenses of sale, or unless the board of directors otherwise orders, said delinquent stock shall be sold at a public auction to such bidder who shall offer to pay the full amount of the balance on the subscription together with accrued interest, costs of advertisement and expenses of sale, for the smallest number of shares or fraction of a share. The stock so purchased shall be transferred to such purchaser in the books of the corporation and a certificate for such stock shall be issued in the purchaser's favor. The remaining shares, if any, shall be credited in favor of the delinquent stockholder who shall likewise be entitled to the issuance of a certificate of stock covering such shares.

Should there be no bidder at the public auction who offers to pay the full amount of the balance on the subscription together with accrued interest, costs of advertisement, and expenses of sale, for the smallest number of shares or fraction of a share, the corporation may, subject to the provisions of this Code, bid for the same, and the total amount due shall be credited as fully paid in the books of the corporation. Title to all the shares of stock covered by the subscription shall be vested in the corporation as treasury shares and may be disposed of by said corporation in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

||SECTION 68. When Sale May be Questioned. — ||

No action to recover delinquent stock sold can be sustained upon the ground of irregularity or defect in the notice of sale, or in the sale itself of the delinquent stock, unless the party seeking to maintain such action first pays or tenders to the party holding the stock the sum for which the same was sold, with interest from the date of sale at the legal rate. No such action shall be maintained unless a complaint is filed within six (6) months from the date of sale.

Holders of subscribed shares not fully paid which are not delinquent shall have all the rights of a stockholder.

||SECTION 72. Lost or Destroyed Certificates. — ||

The following procedure shall be followed by a corporation in issuing new certificates of stock in lieu of those which have been lost, stolen or destroyed:

(a) The registered owner of a certificate of stock in a corporation or such person's legal representative shall file with the corporation an affidavit in triplicate setting forth, if possible, the circumstances as to how the certificate was lost, stolen or destroyed, the number of shares represented by such certificate, the serial number of the certificate and the name of the corporation which issued the same. The owner of such certificate of stock shall also submit such other information and evidence as may be deemed necessary; and

(b) After verifying the affidavit and other information and evidence with the books of the corporation, the corporation shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the place where the corporation has its principal office, once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks at the expense of the registered owner of the certificate of stock which has been lost, stolen or destroyed. The notice shall state the name of the corporation, the name of the registered owner, the serial number of the certificate, the number of shares represented by such certificate, and shall state that after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of the last publication, if no contest has been presented to the corporation regarding the certificate of stock, the right to make such contest shall be barred and the corporation shall cancel the lost, destroyed or stolen certificate of stock in its books. In lieu thereof, the corporation shall issue a new certificate of stock, unless the registered owner files a bond or other security as may be required, effective for a period of one (1) year, for such amount and in such form and with such sureties as may be satisfactory to the board of directors, in which case a new certificate may be issued even before the expiration of the one (1) year period provided herein. If a contest has been presented to the corporation or if an action is pending in court regarding the ownership of the certificate of stock which has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the issuance of the new certificate of stock in lieu thereof shall be suspended until the court renders a final decision regarding the ownership of the certificate of stock which has been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Except in case of fraud, bad faith, or negligence on the part of the corporation and its officers, no action may be brought against any corporation which shall have issued certificate of stock in lieu of those lost, stolen or destroyed pursuant to the procedure above-described.

||SECTION 80. When the Right of Appraisal May Be Exercised. — ||

Any stockholder of a corporation shall have the right to dissent and demand payment of the fair value of the shares in the following instances:

(a) In case an amendment to the articles of incorporation has the effect of changing or restricting the rights of any stockholder or class of shares, or of authorizing preferences in any respect superior to those of outstanding shares of any class, or of extending or shortening the term of corporate existence;

(b) In case of sale, lease, exchange, transfer, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of all or substantially all of the corporate property and assets as provided in this Code;

(c) In case of merger or consolidation; and

(d) In case of investment of corporate funds for any purpose other than the primary purpose of the corporation.

||SECTION 81. How Right is Exercised. — ||

The dissenting stockholder who votes against a proposed corporate action may exercise the right of appraisal by making a written demand on the corporation for the payment of the fair value of shares held within thirty (30) days from the date on which the vote was taken: Provided, That failure to make the demand within such period shall be deemed a waiver of the appraisal right. If the proposed corporate action is implemented, the corporation shall pay the stockholder, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates of stock representing the stockholder's shares, the fair value thereof as of the day before the vote was taken, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of such corporate action.

If, within sixty (60) days from the approval of the corporate action by the stockholders, the withdrawing stockholder and the corporation cannot agree on the fair value of the shares, it shall be determined and appraised by three (3) disinterested persons, one of whom shall be named by the stockholder, another by the corporation, and the third by the two (2) thus chosen. The findings of the majority of the appraisers shall be final, and their award shall be paid by the corporation within thirty (30) days after such award is made: Provided, That no payment shall be made to any dissenting stockholder unless the corporation has unrestricted retained earnings in its books to cover such payment: Provided, further, That upon payment by the corporation of the agreed or awarded price, the stockholder shall forthwith transfer the shares to the corporation.

||SECTION 82. Effect of Demand and Termination of Right. — ||

From the time of demand for payment of the fair value of a stockholder's shares until either the abandonment of the corporate action involved or the purchase of the said shares by the corporation, all rights accruing to such shares, including voting and dividend rights, shall be suspended in accordance with the provisions of this Code, except the right of such stockholder to receive payment of the fair value thereof: Provided, That if the dissenting stockholder is not paid the value of the said shares within thirty (30) days after the award, the voting and dividend rights shall immediately be restored.

||SECTION 83. When Right to Payment Ceases. — ||

No demand for payment under this Title may be withdrawn unless the corporation consents thereto. If, however, such demand for payment is withdrawn with the consent of the corporation, or if the proposed corporate action is abandoned or rescinded by the corporation or disapproved by the Commission where such approval is necessary, or if the Commission determines that such stockholder is not entitled to the appraisal right, then the right of the stockholder to be paid the fair value of the shares shall cease, the status as the stockholder shall be restored, and all dividend distributions which would have accrued on the shares shall be paid to the stockholder.

||SECTION 84. Who Bears Costs of Appraisal. — ||

The costs and expenses of appraisal shall be borne by the corporation, unless the fair value ascertained by the appraisers is approximately the same as the price which the corporation may have offered to pay the stockholder, in which case they shall be borne by the latter. In the case of an action to recover such fair value, all cost and expenses shall be assessed against the corporation, unless the refusal of the stockholder to receive payment was unjustified.

||SECTION 85. Notation on Certificates; Rights of Transferee. — ||

Within ten (10) days after demanding payment for shares held, a dissenting stockholder shall submit the certificates of stock representing the shares to the corporation for notation that such shares are dissenting shares. Failure to do so shall, at the option of the corporation, terminate the rights under this Title. If shares represented by the certificates bearing such notation are transferred, and the certificates consequently cancelled, the rights of the transferor as a dissenting stockholder under this Title shall cease and the transferee shall have all the rights of a regular stockholder; and all dividend distributions which would have accrued on such shares shall be paid to the transferee.

Any corporation may be incorporated as a close corporation, except mining or oil companies, stock exchanges, banks, insurance companies, public utilities, educational institutions and corporations declared to be vested with public interest in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

The provisions of this Title shall primarily govern close corporations: Provided, That other Titles in this Code shall apply suppletorily, except as otherwise provided under this Title.

||SECTION 96. Articles of Incorporation. — ||

Restrictions on the right to transfer shares must appear in the articles of incorporation, in the bylaws, as well as in the certificate of stock; otherwise, the same shall not be binding on any purchaser in good faith.

(b) If the articles of incorporation of a close corporation states the number of persons, not exceeding twenty (20), who are entitled to be stockholders of record, and if the certificate for such stock conspicuously states such number, and the issuance or transfer of stock to any person would cause the stock to be held by more than such number of persons, the person to whom such stock is issued or transferred is conclusively presumed to have notice of this fact.

(c) If a stock certificate of a close corporation conspicuously shows a restriction on transfer of the corporation's stock and the transferee acquires the stock in violation of such restriction, the transferee is conclusively presumed to have notice of the fact that the stock was acquired in violation of the restriction.

(d) Whenever a person to whom stock of a close corporation has been issued or transferred has or is conclusively presumed under this section to have notice of: (1) the person's ineligibility to be a stockholder of the corporation; or (2) that the transfer of stock would cause the stock of the corporation to be held by more than the number of persons permitted under its articles of incorporation; or (3) that the transfer violates a restriction on transfer of stock, the corporation may, at its option, refuse to register the transfer in the name of the transferee.

(e) The provisions of subsection (d) shall not be applicable if the transfer of stock, though contrary to subsections (a), (b) or (c), has been consented to by all the stockholders of the close corporation, or if the close corporation has amended its articles of incorporation in accordance with this Title.

(f) The term "transfer," as used in this section, is not limited to a transfer for value.

(b) A written agreement signed by two (2) or more stockholders may provide that in exercising any voting right, the shares held by them shall be voted as provided or as agreed, or in accordance with a procedure agreed upon by them.

(c) No provision in a written agreement signed by the stockholders, relating to any phase of corporate affairs, shall be invalidated between the parties on the ground that its effect is to make them partners among themselves.

(d) A written agreement among some or all of the stockholders in a close corporation shall not be invalidated on the ground that it relates to the conduct of the business and affairs of the corporation as to restrict or interfere with the discretion or powers of the board of directors: Provided, That such agreement shall impose on the stockholders who are parties thereto the liabilities for managerial acts imposed on directors by this Code.

(e) Stockholders actively engaged in the management or operation of the business and affairs of a close corporation shall be held to strict fiduciary duties to each other and among themselves. The stockholders shall be personally liable for corporate torts unless the corporation has obtained reasonably adequate liability insurance.

||SECTION 100. When a Board Meeting is Unnecessary or Improperly Held. — ||

||SECTION 103. Deadlocks. — ||

Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the close corporation's articles of incorporation, bylaws, or stockholders' agreement, if the directors or stockholders are so divided on the management of the corporation's business and affairs that the votes required for a corporate action cannot be obtained, with the consequence that the business and affairs of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the advantage of the stockholders generally, the Commission, upon written petition by any stockholder, shall have the power to arbitrate the dispute. In the exercise of such power, the Commission shall have authority to make appropriate orders, such as: (a) cancelling or altering any provision contained in the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or any stockholders' agreement; (b) cancelling, altering or enjoining a resolution or act of the corporation or its board of directors, stockholders, or officers; (c) directing or prohibiting any act of the corporation or its board of directors, stockholders, officers, or other persons party to the action; (d) requiring the purchase at their fair value of shares of any stockholder, either by the corporation regardless of the availability of unrestricted retained earnings in its books, or by the other stockholders; (e) appointing a provisional director; (f) dissolving the corporation; or (g) granting such other relief as the circumstances may warrant.

A provisional director shall be an impartial person who is neither a stockholder nor a creditor of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and whose further qualifications, if any, may be determined by the Commission. A provisional director is not a receiver of the corporation and does not have the title and powers of a custodian or receiver. A provisional director shall have all the rights and powers of a duly elected director, including the right to be notified of and to vote at meetings of directors until removed by order of the Commission or by all the stockholders.
